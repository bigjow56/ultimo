# Overview

This is a React-based gym satisfaction survey application with Google Sheets integration. The application features a responsive landing page where gym members can submit feedback about their experience at "Academia RM". The survey collects both optional personal information (name, email) and mandatory feedback across various categories including training schedule, experience level, staff interaction, and overall satisfaction. All responses are automatically saved to Google Sheets for easy analysis and management.
